# Floppy_Boards
Floppy Boards are a series of breakout boards for rapid prototyping which I developed as an alternative of Arduino.

These boards can provide good performance and many useful modules (such as: USB, I2C, SPI, timers etc.). I want to make several models, in order to have different boards for different applications.
For example, I am considering developing options for:

- Built-in battery monitoring & charging.   (to be done)
- Built-in DC motor control.                (to be done)
- Built-in servos & stepper-motor control.  (to be done)

# Why as an alternative to Arduino boards?
I am building this board because I was looking for a cheap, powerful and well supported development board in the marketplace, but I donâ€™t find anything I like. On the other hand, I am learning a lot while making these Floppy Boards.
## Features
- Programmable with Arduino IDE and STMCubeIDE
- Planty of the module
- Small dimensions
- Lots of GPIO

### The most recent version I've made
![Floppy Bard 3.1](https://floppylab.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FB-3.1-no-sfondo-960x768.png)

The third version of the Floppy Board, this board has incorporated all possible improvements regarding the interface between the Floppy Board and the computer.
In this version, it excels over the others in the following aspects:

- The last upgrade includes a USB-C port, allowing you to power our projects and load firmware directly without the need for an ST-Link.
- Additionally, the board has been further downsized, featuring two holes on each side when inserted into a breadboard!
- I've added a pin where you can access the incoming 5V voltage from the USB , enabling you to power external circuits directly from the convenient USB-C.
- The silkscreen has been completely updated, making it much more legible and aesthetically pleasing.
- inally, we've introduced the option to install an EEPROM on the back of the board , enabling you to permanently save small amounts of data even in the absence of power.

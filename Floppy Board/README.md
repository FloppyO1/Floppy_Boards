# Floppy Board

Inside this folder there are all the files of the base version of the Floppy Board.

There are 3 major versions:
- v1.0, that is the first prototype that I've made.
- v2.0, which is the second attempt, is an improved version of 1.0, it is good because it is the smallest of the three versions.
- v3.x, which is the last version that includes the connections between the Floppy Board and the computer.

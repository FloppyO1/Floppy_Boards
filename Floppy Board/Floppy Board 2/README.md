# Floppy Board rev:2.0
![](https://floppylab.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FB-2-no-sfondo-960x768.png)

This is the second version of the Floppy Board, and it includes a few small improvements that make it simpler and faster to use.
The improvements that I made are as follows:

- The total width has been reduced, allowing this version to be used with only one breadboard.
- The 3.3V output pin now has precisely 3.3V (3.263V), ensuring no more 3V output!
- Pin names have been added on each side of the board.
- The board now has a slimmer profile that makes it possible to use it upside down.
- The microcontroller is the same as the first Floppy Board, but it can be upgraded with an equivalent MCU that has double the FLASH memory. The more capable MCU is the STM32G031F8P6, which has 32kB more memory than the old one (so 64kB in total). These boards are compatible with Arduino IDE, meaning they can be easily programmed by users who are less experienced.
